# Best Practices for SmartChart Development

# Project Context and Architecture
SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
  You are a senior developer working on a Python project.
  Required file reads on startup:
  - docs/architecture.mermaid: System architecture and component relationships
  - docs/technical.md: Technical specifications and patterns
  - tasks/tasks.md: Current development tasks and requirements
  - tasks/status.md: Project progress and state
  - docs/project_structure.md: Project directory structure

Before making any changes:
  1. Parse and understand system architecture from docs/architecture.mermaid
  2. Understand project structure from docs/project_structure.md
  3. Check current task context from tasks/tasks.md
  4. Update progress in tasks/status.md
  5. Follow technical specifications from docs/technical.md

# File Management Rules
ON_FILE_CHANGE: |
  Required actions after any code changes:
  1. READ docs/architecture.mermaid to verify architectural compliance
  2. UPDATE tasks/status.md with:
     - Current progress
     - Any new issues encountered
     - Completed items
  3. VALIDATE changes against docs/technical.md specifications
  4. VERIFY task progress against tasks/tasks.md
  5. Verify compliance with docs/project_structure.md

# Architecture Understanding
READ_ARCHITECTURE: |
  File: docs/architecture.mermaid
  Required parsing:
  1. Load and parse complete Mermaid diagram
  2. Extract and understand:
     - Module boundaries and relationships
     - Data flow patterns
     - System interfaces
     - Component dependencies
  3. Validate any changes against architectural constraints
  4. Ensure new code maintains defined separation of concerns
  
  Error handling:
  1. If file not found: STOP and notify user
  2. If diagram parse fails: REQUEST clarification
  3. If architectural violation detected: WARN user

# Task Management
TASK_WORKFLOW: |
  Required files:
  - tasks/tasks.md: Source of task definitions
  - tasks/status.md: Progress tracking
  - docs/technical.md: Implementation guidelines
  
  Workflow steps:
  1. READ tasks/tasks.md:
     - Parse current task requirements
     - Extract acceptance criteria
     - Identify dependencies
  
  2. VALIDATE against docs/architecture.mermaid:
     - Confirm architectural alignment
     - Check component interactions
  
  3. UPDATE docs/status.md:
     - Mark task as in-progress
     - Track completion of sub-tasks
     - Document any blockers
  
  4. IMPLEMENT following TDD:
     - Create test files first
     - Implement to pass tests
     - Update status on test completion

# Error Prevention
VALIDATION_RULES: |
  1. Verify type consistency
  2. Check for potential null/undefined
  3. Validate against business rules
  4. Ensure error handling


# Code Style
CODE_STYLE: |
  - Follow PEP8; enforce with `black` and `flake8`.
  - Use type hints for all function signatures.
  - Modularize code: separate logic, rendering, and API layers.
  - Write unit tests under `tests/`; aim for ≥80% coverage.


# Git Workflow
GIT_WORKFLOW: |
  - Create feature branches named `feature/<task-id>-<short-desc>`.
  - Reference task IDs in commit messages.
  - Rebase and squash before merging to `main`.

# Testing & CI
TESTING_CI: |
  - Automate linting, type checks, and tests in your CI pipeline.
  - Add `pytest` and `flake8` as pre-commit hooks.

# Releases
RELEASES: |
  - Update `CHANGELOG.md` and bump version in `README.md`.
  - Tag releases on GitHub.
